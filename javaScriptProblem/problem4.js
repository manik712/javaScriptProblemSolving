// //Print the factorial of a number n.
// [Factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a
//   given positive integer and denoted by that integer. ]

//   Example :
//   7! (factorial of 7) = 1x2x3x4x5x6x7 = 5040
//   5! (factorial of 5) = 1x2x3x4x5 = 120
//   3! (factorial of 3) = 1x2x3 = 6
//   0! Is always 1
//   Qs5. Find the largest number in an array with only positive numbers.
