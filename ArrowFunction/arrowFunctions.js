//Arrow functions were introduced in ES6.
//Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax
let myFunction = (a, b) => a * b;

//Before Arrow:

hello = function () {
  return "Hello World!";
};

//With Arrow Function:

hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}

//Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:
hello = () => "Hello World!";
