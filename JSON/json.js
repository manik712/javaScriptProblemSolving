What is JSON?

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format
JSON is language independent *

  is text only. Code for reading and generating 
  JSON data can be written in any programming language.

JSON Example



*/

{
  "employees"[
    ({ firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" },
    { firstName: "Anna", lastName: "Smith" },
    { firstName: "Peter", lastName: "Jones" })
  ];
}

/*
The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.

Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native JavaScript objects.



JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays
